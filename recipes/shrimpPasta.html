      <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 chopped large tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes. Drain and set aside until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large
        oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant,
        about 30 seconds. Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and dill; cook
        until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 1
        1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate, leaving any
        cooking juices in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat.
        Whisk in flour until fully combined and starting to turn golden, 30
        seconds to 1 minute. Whisk in chicken broth until combined, then repeat
        with milk. Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; bring to a
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and Romano; stir until cheeses begin to melt and
        sauce is creamy. Add 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, then mix in 1/2 of
        the cooked pasta. Add more pasta if there is enough sauce to coat it.
        Stir in shrimp, then top with remaining mozzarella, Parmesan, and
        parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top and bubbling around the
        edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
