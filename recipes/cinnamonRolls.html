    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Â½ cup warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
      <li>3 tbsp molasses</li>
      <li>1/4 oz active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp molasses</li>
      <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tsp ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 oz cream cheese</li>
      <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tbsp whole milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="steps">Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine warm milk, molasses, and yeast in a small bowl and stir together
        until combined. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar, salt, and 4 1/2 cups of the flour to the work bowl of a stand
        mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low speed until just
        combined, about 15 seconds. With mixer running on low speed, add milk
        mixture, sour cream, butter, and egg. Continue beating until dough
        forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Switch to a dough hook attachment. Beat on
        medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic, 6 to 9 minutes; add
        remaining 1/4 cup flour 1/2 to 1 teaspoon at a time, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough in a large bowl greased with cooking spray and turn to coat.
        Cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm draft-free place
        until dough has doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spray a 13x 9-inch pan with cooking spray. Lightly punch down dough. On
        a lightly floured surface, roll dough into an 18x10-inch rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/2 cup butter over dough for the filling. In a small bowl, stir
        together brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves until well
        combined. Sprinkle evenly over butter. Starting with one long side, roll
        dough into a log, pinching seam to seal. Slice into 12 rolls. Place
        rolls in the prepared pan. Cover, and let rise in a warm draft-free
        place until doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until golden brown, 25 to 30
        minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cream cheese and 4 tablespoons butter to the bowl of a stand mixer
        fitted with the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until smooth, 1
        to 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk. Beat on medium
        speed until smooth, about 1 minute. If desired, add more milk, 1
        teaspoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Spread glaze
        over warm rolls.
